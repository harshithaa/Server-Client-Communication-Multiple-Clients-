Compilation and Execution:
Please compile using the enclosed makefile. Compilation will produce two executables called server and client. 

To run, first execute ./server. Then, in a separate terminal (optionally on a different host) execute ./client <hostname>, where hostname is the domain name or ip address of the host running the server. Type any string into the client terminal; the string will then be sent to and displayed by the server. 

Extra Credit:
The server can receive messages from multiple clients simultaneously. To test this facility, simply open multiple client applications in the manner specified above: the server will display messages from all clients. This functionality was introduced using multithreading

Reference: 
Both the client and the server are broadly modeled on the example found on pp 42-44 of Peterson and Davie's Computer Networks: a Systems Approach (5th ed.).
